# Example : watchdog.001

# Description
This example shows how to handle the XtratuM watchdog together the use of the 
two types of timers provided by XtratuM

# Partition definition
There are two partitions.
P0 will program the timer based on the Hardware clock. Reload the watchdog with 1000msec.
P1 will program the timer based on the Execution clock.

# Configuration table
Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

MAF = 1000 msec 		
P0: S   0 ms  D 500 ms
P1: S 500 ms  D 500 ms

The watchdog initial value is set to 500ms.
The hardware watchdog is configured to reload a 1000ms.

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partitions. 
During the execution, P0 will install a handler for the timer IRQ
and will set the HW timer based on HW_CLOCK at a period of 1 second.
The timer handler also reload the watchdog with a budget of 1 second. 
The partition 1 expects that handler is called 10 times (10 seconds),
during this time the watchdog is reloaded. Then the partition is halted.

P1 will install a handler for the timer irq and will set the EXEC timer
based on EXEC clock at a period of 1 second. When the timer handler is 
called 10 times the partition is halted. As the watchdog is not reloaded
after the partition 0 halts, the execution will not finished if a 
hardware watchdog is configured.
