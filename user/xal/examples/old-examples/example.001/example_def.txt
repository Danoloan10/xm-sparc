# Example : 001

# Description

This example shows the ability to execute several partitions concurrently according to a scheduling plan defined in the CT. 

# Partition definition
Three independent partitions with the same code are built. 
Each partition performs an infinite loop increasing the value of an  integer variable.
This variable is printed at the beginning of each loop.
P1 is supervisor. 
P2 and P3 are user partitions.

Termination: Each partition finishes when a counter value is reached (Halt partition). 

# Configuration table
Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.
P1 is defined as supervisor. 
P2 and P3 are not supervisors.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

MAF = 500 msec 		
P1: S   0 ms  D 200 ms  
P2: S 200 ms  D 100 ms  
P3: S 300 ms  D  50 ms  


# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partitions. 
During the execution, partitions will print the counter value.
When the counter limit is achieved, the partitions halt.
