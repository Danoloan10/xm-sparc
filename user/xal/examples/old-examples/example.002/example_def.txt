# Name Example 002

# Description

This example shows the ability to virtualise some system resources.
The virtualised resources are: serial port and timers (hardware and execution timers).

# Validated requirements

# Partition definition
The test defines 4 partitions: P1, P2, P3 and P4. 
P1 and P2 programs two periodic timers (hardware and execution) and enable and unmask 
the associated interrupts.
When the interrupt arrives to the partition, the timer interrupt handler stores the clock values.
When a number of hw interrupts is achieved, P1 and P2 print the clock values and the differences with respect to the previous.
The periods of the timers are: 330msec (hardware clock) and 220msec (execution clock).
Each time a new slot starts, the hw timers are sets with respect to the slot start.

P3 and P4 are simple counting partitions.

Termination: Each partition finishes when a counter value is reached.

# Configuration table
Basic configuration.
P1 is defined as supervisor. P2, P3 and P4 are not supervisor.

MAF = 3 sec  \\
P1: S    0 s  D 1 sec  \\
P3: S    1 s  D 100 msec  \\
P2: S 1200 ms D 1 sec  \\
P4: S 2200 ms  D 150 msec  \\

# Expected results
P1 and P2 will print the ocurrence of the interrupts each 330msec and 220msec when P1 and P2 are scheduled.
The execution timer get always differences of 220msec. The hardware timer get differences of 330msec and one
of 2000msec, this last is due to the scheduling of the partitions.
