EXAMPLE 002

# Description
This example shows the use of sampling ports. 


# Partition definition
The scenario consists in three partitions P1, P2 and P3.
P1 writes in port1 a random value. P2 and P3 read from port1 the value and compute some new value
writting, respectively,  in port2 and port3 the computed value.
P1 reads from port2 and prot3 and print the values.


# Configuration table

P1 ==channel==> P2  (port1)
P1 ==channel==> P2  (port1)
P2 ==channel==> P1  (port2)
P3 ==channel==> P1  (port3)

Sched plan;
P1 100 ms => writes the value in port1
P2 100 ms => reads from p1 ; computes; writes port2
P3 100 ms => reads from p1 ; computes; writes port3
P1 100 ms => reads from p2 and p3; print the values


# Expected results
1st MAF: open sampling ports;
Next MAFs:
- P1 generate a random value (sensor simulation) and writes in port1
- P2 reads from p1 ; computes; writes port2
- P3 reads from p1 ; computes; writes port3
- P1 reads from p2 and p3; print the values
