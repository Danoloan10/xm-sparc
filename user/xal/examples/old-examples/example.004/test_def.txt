# Name
Test_18.1

# Description

Test the ability to use some specific hypercalls by a supervisor partition and to control the execution of other partitions. 

# Validated requirements

# Partition definition
This test uses 4 partitions. P3 and P4 (same code partition3.c). 
P1 and P2 use the same code to test the hypercalls and control the execution of P3 and P4 respectively. 
P1 will control the execution of P3. P2 will control the execution of P4. 

P1 and P2 will call the following hypercalls: 
 XM_hm_open, 
 XM_trace_open,
 XM_suspend_partition,
 XM_get_partition_status,
 XM_resume_partition,
 XM_halt_partition,
 XM_halt_system, 

which only can be used by supervisor partitions. 

P3 and P4 print a counter and wait for the next slot. 


# Configuration table
Basic configuration.
P1 is supervisor. 
P2, P3 and P4 are no supervisor. 

MAF = 2000 msec		\\
P3: S    0 ms  D 50 ms \\
P4: S   50 ms  D 50 ms \\
P2: S  500 ms  D 500 ms \\
P1: S 1000 ms  D 500 ms \\

# Expected results
P1 success in all hypercalls.(return value >= 0)
P2 fails in all hypercall return value < 0)
P3 is suspended, resumed, halted by P1.
P4 is never suspended, resumed, halted by P4
